                <h2>What is Metadata</h2>
                <p>
                    Metadata simply put is information about data. It helps us to understand the structure , 
                    nature, and context of the data. Metadata also makes it easy to search and retrieve data. 
                    The quality and reliability of data is kept in check due to metadata. Another definition 
                    describes metadata as “any data which conveys knowledge about an item without requiring 
                    examination of the item itself.”

                    <p>
                        Metadata can be used to track things like the dates 
                        associated with a document's associated record schedule.

                        Metadata can be used to flag a security setting, validating 
                        access and edit rights, and thus controlling distribution

                    <p>
                        Metadata can also be used as a way to capture users' rating of content, for 
                        example, indicating that content is "valuable” or "useless" or even "dated."

                        Metadata is extremely valuable as a search and retrieval enhancing mechanism by enabling 
                        users to target a query on a certain field, such as author, subject, date, etc.
