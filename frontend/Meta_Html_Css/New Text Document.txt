What is Metadata
Metadata simply put is information about data. It helps us to understand the structure , nature, and context of the data. Metadata also makes it easy to search and retrieve data. The quality and reliability of data is kept in check due to metadata.
Another definition describes metadata as “any data which conveys knowledge about an item without requiring examination of the item itself.” 

Why is it important
Classification 
Information Security 
Metadata can be used to track things like the dates associated with a document's associated record schedule.
Metadata can be used to flag a security setting, validating access and edit rights, and thus controlling distribution
Customer Experience
Information "Findability" 
Metadata can also be used as a way to capture users' rating of content, for example, indicating that content is "valuable” or "useless" or even "dated."

 Metadata is extremely valuable as a search and retrieval enhancing mechanism by enabling users to target a query on a certain field, such as author, subject, date, etc.
